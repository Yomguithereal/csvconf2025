# Notes

Love letter
sqlite/csv meme
ethos de sobriété
it is a free idea, that does not require proprietary software, no lock-in
why is csv a lingua franca
bridge between social scientists & engineers working on the data
tabular data affordances (table nice, weird json huh)
rewards clever engineering tricks: reverse reading, parallel processing, resuming, cursed sampling
suits both tiny & big data
can be used as a log format or append-only (useful to resume)
I am sure we will be able to process CSV in 50 years. Can the same be said of parquet?
csv bgzipped databases of tweets. can you collect billions of tweets reliably with only CSV files as backing? yes
we have been building open-source tools around CSV for 10 years
best structured text stream wrt unix philosophy

xan, minet, table2net, takoyaki, catwalk, casanova -> interoperability

the médialab -> we build open source tools for social sciences and the civil society
they usually all work with CSV data
but why?

1. a lingua franca
  * because of the affordances
  * because it is a free and collective idea
  * because it is simple
  * because it is text (no lock-in)
  * because it is stringly typed (drop this)
  * between engineers and researchers
2. it fits an ethos of sobriety (albeit not exactly a chosen one) students etc.
  * concise
  * efficient
  * rewards clever albeit oblique engineering
